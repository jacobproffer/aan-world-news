Some 200 contractors, working for Blackwater, have been operating throughout the province of Prei Khmaoch Luong since August, six months since their initial arrival in Cambodia.

Allegations have recently spread of a failed operation conducted by the private military company, which claimed the lives of 7 Cambodian soldiers. Although there is no current proof, the operation is suspected to be a show of force against the Royal Cambodian Navy after two IDAP employees were killed by Cambodian forces when delivering supplies to the local populace. Blackwater continues to deny any involvement.

Cambodian officials say that Blackwater has caused trouble since their arrival and that they continue to be a threat to security.

Blackwater president, Poda Makarovich said: "We are strictly in Cambodia for IDAP security only. Combat operations would be counterproductive and against our contract."

The investigation is ongoing.
