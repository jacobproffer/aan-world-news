Some 200 contractors, working for Blackwater, have been operating throughout the province of Prei Khmaoch Luong since August, six months since their initial arrival in Cambodia.

Within the past week, rumors have spread of a failed operation conducted by the private military company. The operation was said to be a show of force but ended with multiple casualties. Blackwater continues to deny any involvement.

Blackwater president, Poda Makarovich said: "We are strictly in Cambodia for IDAP security only. Combat operations would be counterproductive and against our contract."
