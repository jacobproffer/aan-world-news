US and Coalition Combatant Commands have surged the current amount of troops on the ground in Iraq from 1,500 to almost 7,000 in response to the United Nations plea for help after on of its outposts responsible for aid in an area North East of Baghdad was attacked by ISIS. The question remains what the Coalition Forces will do with those numbers and where we will be a year from now.
