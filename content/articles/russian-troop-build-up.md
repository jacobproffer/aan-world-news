Tensions in the Baltics are getting worse day by day, as Russian forces start to reach the border with Estonia, "fortifying their positions". This is what the correspondent of the Russian Brigade in the area, Colonel Fyodor Vladimirovich Beketov said to AAN News, stating that "NATO is moving a lot of troops near our borders, especially near Kaliningrad. We have also decided to move a mechanized brigade as a response to such actions, also to prevent any kind of unwanted actions from our western neighbours. Meanwhile, joint exercises between NATO forces continue in the country, with units from the British Rifles and Mercian Regiment being deployed in the Ida-Viru County, near Narva for the Joint Exercise Cabrit with the Estonian Defence Forces.
