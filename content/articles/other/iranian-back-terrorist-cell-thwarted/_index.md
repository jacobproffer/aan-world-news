On 04/16/2020, a local news affiliate reported the capture and subsequent ransom request for eight Afghan National Police being held by a Iranian-backed terrorist cell.

While the U.S. Department of Defense denies any responsibility for the rescue of the eight Afghan National Police, a unnamed credible source reported several U.S. Army aircraft departing Taji Air Base, Iraq earlier that morning. With the recent news of the infamous Blackwater private military contracting group being awarded funding for operational status in the region BBN can't help but question the coincidence.

While many questions will undoubtedly go unanswered a more concerning issue pushes to the forefront, will Al-Shareef Al Bagdera be held liable for the Iranian Terrorist Cell operating in the region?
