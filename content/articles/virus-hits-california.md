The Center for Disease Control confirmed on Friday that a family of three in California, found dead on Thursday afternoon, tested positive for a flesh eating virus.

Prior to the discovery, the Rudwells hadn't been seen in days. The father, Aiden Rudwell, was a member of the Santa Catalina yacht club. After he missed multiple meetings without contact, the club president asked for a well-being check to be conducted. Police officers then found Aiden, his wife and young son dead inside the home. Their bodies showed signs of heavy decay.

Officers also encountered a pungent smell in the home. Fearing chemical or biological exposure, they called for additional support. CDC officials arrived and quickly sealed off the area. The officers who had entered the home were then said to be put into quarantine.

The director of the Center for Disease Control in California said: "At this time, we can confirm that the Rudwell family died from an unkown flesh eating virus. We're unsure how they contracted the virus but we do know it is not airborne. The officers who conducted the well-being check of the Rudwell home have been tested and have been cleared of any possible infections. The CDC will continue to investigate the virus and additional testing will be done."

As of today, the neighborhood that the Rudwell lived in has been sealed off. All 23 residents have been temporarily relocated while the CDC continues to test and search for signs of the virus.
