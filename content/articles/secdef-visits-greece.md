Janus Security Contractors were on hand to provide escort security for the SECDEF as he makes his way across Greece. Reportedly his next stop will be in Iraq for a de-escalation briefing with the current PM of the nation. With the recent events that have taken place north east of Baghdad where a United Nations Air Outpost was destroyed by ISIS many are waiting for a favorable outcome for Iraq at the US's expense.
