Russian MoD announced increase in the military presence on the Chernarus border as a response to rebels in northern Chernarus.

## Rebels in Chernarus concern Russia

"Chernarus cannot handle the rebels within their territory and we are concerned about our security." says Colonel Anatolii Dragutin. "We have decided to move three motorized brigades near the border to prevent the rebels from crossing the border illegally."

"We are open to cooperation with Chernarus to end the rebellion."

## Chernarus declines Russian help offer

Chernarus Minister of Internal Security expressed concern about letting Russian Forces into Chernarus to help fight the rebels. "For now, we do not think we need any help. And we think it is too much to call some criminals a rebellion."
