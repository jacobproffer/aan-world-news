Sunday, 28 February 2038. With the Horizon Islands still reeling from the destruction of the Horizon Islands Defence Force late last year. The islands' of Tanoa has exploded in to turmoil as CSAT and NATO forces fight for control over the islands'. The fighting reached a new high as Napalm was used near a Banana plantation in the centre of Tanoa, today. The number of casualties has yet to be determined. NATO declines and condemns the use of Napalm on its forces protecting the plantation. Local Syndicate freedom fighters report seeing a CSAT VTOL in the area before the Napalm struck. The freedom fighter wishing only to be known as Jackal recorded the image as Napalm struck both Syndicate and NATO forces as they fought for control over the Plantation. CSAT declined to comment on the incident. CSAT aggression has been reported through out Tanoa. The towns of Vagalala, Leqa, La Foa, and Tobakoro have been completely destroyed in reprisal attacks against Syndicate forces. The death toll so far is under 200 with more expected as the fighting continues.
