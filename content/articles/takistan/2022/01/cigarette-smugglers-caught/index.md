After months of infiltration and espionage, Takistan's security services finally managed to get their hands on cigarette smuglers that tried to avoid export tax.

Only recently they've found out that a small village in Anizay is the main staging point for smuggled goods. In cooperation with Anizay police, $400,000 worth of cigarettes were recovered during the raid on unexpecting smugglers.

They're awaiting extradition to Takistan in the capital of Anizay. However, it's very likely that Anizay will want to punish them too as it's estimated they avoided around $200,000 customs fee. Negotiations are still in progress between both governments.
