CSAT troops take part in Russia joint military exercises led by the armed forces of Russia, CSAT’s defense ministry said on Wednesday. CSAT’s participation in the joint exercises was "unrelated to the current international and regional situation in the Mediterranean", said Zhang Wei the Minister of CSAT. Last month, Moscow announced plans to hold a joint exercise with its new strategic partner CSAT from Aug. 7th to Sept. 30, even as the number of NATO troops in the Pacific Ocean continue to climb. It said at the time that some special forces would participate, without naming them. CSAT's defense ministry said its participation in the exercises was part of an ongoing, annual defense agreement with Russia. CSAT’s defense Minister said "The aim of the joint military practice is to reinforce the practical and friendly cooperation with the armies, enhancing the level of strategic collaboration among the participating militaries, and strengthen the ability to respond to various security threats," the statement said. Under CSAT’s Minister, Zhang Wei and his Russian counterpart Artyom Petrov, Russia and CSAT grow closer and closer.
