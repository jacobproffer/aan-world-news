### Dissatisfaction of Chernarus citizens grows

Since Chedaks took power in Chernarus, discontent among the population grew instead of dying down. One could wonder why are they still unhappy if the government changed. And they are even more unhappy than ever before.

Today, over 500 people joined protest in Chernogorsk while government sources said there was a small protest of 30 citizens. As far as we've managed to discover, even citizens of Zelenogorsk and Severograd took part in protest.

Initially there was little reaction from Chedaki government and the protest itself was very peaceful, regarding the unhappiness of the citizens. However, quick escalation took place when Militia arrived after an hour and surrounded the crowd with crowd control equipment at the ready. They did not allow anyone to leave the protest. After a few minutes of consternation, the crowd was attacked by Militia units with tear gas, batons and water cannons.

Fortunately, Militia was too disorganized to pin down the whole crowd and they had to retreat after a while, scattered. Several Militia men were pulled into the crowd and disarmed. When the crowd had some room, they seeked an escape and most of them succeeded.

### Brutally quelled protest ends with repercussions

Militia claims that all 30 citizens were identified and sent back home without any use of force. However, there are reports of several people missing after the riot. There are also a lot of hospitalizations due to injuries from beating.

Authorities already warned that students that participated in the protest might end up expelled from Chernogorsk University due to infringement of the University's good name.
