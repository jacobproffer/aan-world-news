Over the last days, there were multiple reports of paramilitary-like personnel in the woods in northern Chernarus. Little details are known right now, but our sources report shots have been fired several times already, although no one has been hurt in any way yet.

We've managed to reach one of the villagers who'd like to stay anonymous. He saw them as they stole a truck full of goods during restock in one of the shops. They arrived in an off-road vehicle and stopped by the truck. Two of them entered the empty cabin, started the engine, fired few shots to scare the delivery man and just drove away, following the off-road vehicle.

The villager suspects that could have been an automatic firearm as the shots were in very short bursts. There were more reports like that so it's possible these are not some angered citizens.

### Ministry of Internal Security calms down, seeks peaceful resolution

Today at 6 PM Ministry of Internal Security called a press conference to share their actions and plans for handling the rebels. Minister calms everyone down as they're investigating possible options. When questioned, the official replies that use of force is also considered, although they hope everything can be sorted out without resorting to violence.

He refused to answer whether military could be used to resolve the issue, as there is suspicion that automatic weapons are involved. For now, minister urges caution and asks to report any suspicious activity to the local militia straight away.

We'll keep you informed how the situation develops in the following days.
