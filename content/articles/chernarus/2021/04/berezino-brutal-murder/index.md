### Disturbing morning violence

This morning Berezino was shocked with brutal murder committed in a household in the central part of the town. Neighbors were woken up around 6 AM by gunshots.

"I heard the gunshots, I think there were at least 2 shooters, maybe more." - says one of direct neighbors, who for obvious reason wanted to stay anonymous. "After a while, the gunshots stopped and I quietely glanced through the window. There I saw a big black van in front of Commander Igiel's family house. Two men were dragging bleeding Igiel's son and two others his daughter. I also noticed a fifth attacker, who seemed like injured. Then they hanged her on the tree, executed her brother right after, and ran."

Other reports from neighbors are very similar, but there is only one thing everyone said exactly the same. It's Militia's Commander Igiel's house.

### Chedaks revenge for clash in the forest?

Some say this could be a revenge for [shootout in the forest a few days ago](../berezino-chedaks-militia-shootout/). Probably Chedaks lost more men than there were found in the forest.

Fate of Commander Igiel and two other missing men is still unknown, although even if alive, they don't have an easy time in captivity.

### Militia response too slow

The Militia arrived few minutes later, too late to save the victims. Some say they didn't want to encounter heavily armed Chedaks, who are suspects for this and other heavy recent crimes. Militia secured the scene and by doing so, they blocked the whole street.

As for now, Militia refuses any comments on the situation.
