Today, Russian Forces left Chernarus entirely.

This is the result of talks between Chedaks and Russians, held in December. On 27th December, Russians agreed their Armed Forces to leave Chernarus. However, some civilian personnel, including government advisors, will remain there for an undisclosed period of time.

### Chedaks grateful for help

Chedaki leader, Serafim Smirnov, expressed his gratitude towards Russian brothers. "Thank you for your help in those dark times for Chedakia. Now we can handle things on our own, we will not forget your invaluable assitance."

### NATO - this does not change anything

A few days ago, when the decision was announced by Russian MoD, NATO General Secretary Magnus Oldenberg said at his press conference: "This changes nothing. "Even if Russian Forces leave Chernarus, they will definitely be ready to reenter promptly."
